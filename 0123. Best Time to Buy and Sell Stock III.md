# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]   
Output: 6   
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.   
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.   
### Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]   
Output: 4   
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.   
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are   
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.   
### Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]   
Output: 0   
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.   

### Solution 1

```java
class Solution {
   public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell2 = 0;
        for(int i=0;i< prices.length;i++){
            buy1 = Math.max(buy1,-prices[i]);
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1,buy1+prices[i]);
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2,sell1-prices[i]);
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2,buy2+prices[i]);
        }
        return sell2;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices==null || prices.length==0) return 0;
        int[] local = new int[3];
        int[] global = new int[3];
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length-1;i++){
            int diff = prices[i+1]-prices[i];
            for(int j=2;j>=1;j--){
                local[j] = Math.max(global[j-1]+(diff>0?diff:0), local[j]+diff);
                global[j] = Math.max(local[j],global[j]);
            }
        }
        return global[2];
    }
}
```
