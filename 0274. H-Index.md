# 274. H-Index
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

### Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]       
Output: 3            
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had             
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.             
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining           
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.              

### Note: 
If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.


### Solution 1
```java
//
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        for(int i = citations.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(citations[i] < citations.length - i) return citations.length - i - 1;
        }
        return citations.length;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        for(int i = 0; i < citations.length; i++){
            if(citations[citations.length - i - 1] < i + 1) return i;
        }
        return citations.length;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2 
```java
// 计数排序
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] papers = new int[n + 1];
        // papers数组的下标是引用的次数，value是当前引用数的论文的数量
        for (int c: citations)
            papers[Math.min(n, c)]++;
        // 找出最大的 k
        int k = n;
        for (int s = papers[n]; k > s; s += papers[k])
            k--;
        return k;
    }
}
```
